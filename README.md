DRIVER FOR SAITEK SWITCH PANEL
==============================

The driver is provided for Linux, (with or without libudev). This contains the Raspberry Pi variant, also.
   
To install this driver, follow the instructions in INSTALL; to run, see RUNNING.

The X windows configuration is modified so that the Switch Panel is ignored as
a mouse device (you may need to log out and in again for this).

The complete source code is also provided, and is compiled specifically for the aircraft
simulated (see INSTALL)

Note that this version does not monitor landing gear state.

I (Dave Attwood dave@attwoods.org.uk) would like to acknowledge and thank Robert Feal-Martinez 
who inspired, tested and contributed to the development of the Raspberry Pi version.

For problems or issues either enter an issue on Github, or email stksp@attwoods.org.uk.

New improved version for Windows and Linux, with external configuration file, 
is available here: https://github.com/daibach142/SaitekSwitch
