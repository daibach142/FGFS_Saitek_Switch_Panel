RUNNING
=======

Note that the Switch Panel software is configured during installation for one
specific aircraft (Cessna 172 and Piper 28-116 are the current options) and
is unlikely to work correctly for other aircraft.

Add the following start option to FlightGear configuration:

	...
	--generic=socket,in,20,,60000,udp,stkswitch_input
	...

Start the simulator first, and wait until initialisation complete.
Set the switches suitably on the panel, and enter 'StartSwitchPanel'

The software will illuminate the forward landing gear light RED,
awaiting a switch change. Operate any switch, and the complete switch
settings on the panel will be transferred to the simulator.

NOTES
=====

Operating the gear up/down lever on both the Cessna and Piper panels will 
operate the primer (UP - out, DOWN - in).

On the Piper, the TAXI switch is repurposed to operate the KAP140 Autopilot 
ACTIVE/STANDBY switch.
