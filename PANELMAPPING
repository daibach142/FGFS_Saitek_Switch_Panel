Format of Panel Mapping Files
=============================

These are simple XML files, for example, part of cessna.xml is:

<plane name="Cessna 172P">
	<switch name="BATTERY">controls/switches/master-bat</switch>
	<switch name="ALT"> controls/switches/master-alt</switch>
	<switch name="AVIONICS">controls/switches/master-avionics    </switch>
	...
	...
	<switch name="LANDING">
		controls/lighting/landing-light
	</switch>

	<gear-retarget>controls/engines/engine/primer-lever</gear-retarget>

	<magnetos>controls/switches/magnetos</magnetos>

	<starter>controls/switches/starter</starter>

</plane>


You should define ALL the <switch name= ..>, preferably in the order given in the existing
files.

If you wish to use the landing gear raise/lower lever to operate a switch 
(code is not written yet to monitor the simulator's gear state), use the <gear-retarget>.

The <magentos> and <starter> are not likely to require modification.	

Place your new XML file in the 'Generators' directory. The './configure' command will
now show it as a candidate for selection to make the source file 'src/SwitchPanel.h'.
A file 'SwitchPanel.html' is also produced in the 'src' directory, containing the XML data
in a tabulated format for checking and reference.
