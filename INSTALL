INSTALLATION
============

Requirements: gcc compiler, xsltproc and optionally, libudev & libudev1-dev

If installing without libudev, determine the device address of the Switch Panel, it's
probably /dev/hidraw2.

Type:
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

Configuration options allow to choose the aircraft for the panel, 
libudev or not (specify the device if not), 
and the IP address of the simulator (typically 127.0.0.1 for same machine).

If the Switch Panel is plugged in, disconnect and reconnect it to change the access
permissions.

The driver can then be started with the command 'StartSwitchPanel'
